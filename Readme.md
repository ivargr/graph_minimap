# Graph Minimap
This is a proof-of-concept implementation of a minimizer-based read mapper for graph-based reference genomes.

It for now only supports single-ended short reads (150 base pairs), and is meant to be used together with [Two Step Graph Mapper](http://github.com/uio-bmi/two_step_graph_mapper) (se that repository for running examples).
